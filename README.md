# MyCosmetics

MyCosmetics is a full-stack web application for browsing and managing cosmetic products. It features a modern frontend built with React and a robust backend powered by Node.js.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `/frontend`: Contains the React single-page application created with Create React App.
- `/backend`: Contains the Node.js/Express REST API server.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get both the frontend and backend running locally.

### Frontend

The frontend is a standard Create React App project.

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start the development server: `npm start`

The application will be running on http://localhost:3000. For more details, see the `frontend/README.md` file.

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js application using Express.

1.  Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start the server: `npm start`

The API server will start, typically on a port like `5000` or as configured in your backend code.
